Design Implementation Choices
-----------------------------

Front End Part
==============

Description
-----------
The front end part of the system is based on Bootstrap and AngularJS.
The UI is simple, prompting the user to input the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle and evaluating the result.
Evaluate and Clear buttons exist to support respective functionality.

The front end part of the system communicates with the back end part asynchronously using AJAX requests.
This approach was preferred against the classic approach of submitting a form and rendering the response of the server(whole page) in browser,
resulting in performance gains especially in larger sites with many assets being loaded in a page.

The evaluation is based on AJAX request in an exposed REST API from the Back End part of the system.
It is implemented with GET HTTP request sending the 3 sides as query parameters and receiving data in JSON format.
GET HTTP request fits best to the nature of the problem (idempotent and safe).
JSON format fits best for this kind of communication as there is no need for unmarshalling to JS objects.

Based on the HTTP status code the system:
HTTP status 200 -> displays the type of the triangle in green background colour.
HTTP status [400, 422, 4xx/5xx] -> displays a general warning message in red background.

All the text content of the UI is provided either from the initial loading of the page or from the REST API responses.
All the text content of the UI is externalize to properties file and could easily be internationalized by providing another file with the translated values.

With regards to AngularJS code, the controllers are separated in an external module and being injected to the main module of our application.
By this approach they could easily be reused and scale.


Back End Part
=============

Description
-----------
The back end part of the system is based on Spring MVC.
It is implemented to serve the home page of the application and also exposes a REST API for triangle evaluation.

Regarding the home page, the view is based on Freemarker template engine which is one of the most widely, production-ready template engines.
The REST API consists of only one endpoint for evaluating the type of the triangle based on user input.

The above technology stack has been chosen, since it is based on Spring ecosystem and taking into account time restrictions.
Specifically Spring boot simplifies Spring configuration with a convention-over-configuration approach and good enough defaults.
Also the maturity of the above technologies, makes them first implementation choice for many modern production systems.

Below you may find a more technical description of the back end part of this application.

HOME PAGE
---------
- HomeController just serves the home page.
- Home page is based on freemarker template engine.
- Static text content of the home page is externalized to message.properties file.

REST API
--------
- GET HTTP request and query parameters are the ideal choice for the kind of problem we have to solve.
- The REST endpoint provides responses in JSON but could be easily updated to support other formats as well ( e.g XML).
- Input validation takes place and appropriate HTTP status codes being returned accordingly.
- HTTP status 422 being returned in case of zero or negative sides of a triangle.
- TriangleController handles the exposed REST endpoint of the application.

TriangleController.java
-----------------------
- Handler of REST endpoint.
- Contains no business logic.
- Performs Input Validation Rules with Java Bean Validation.
- Delegates actual processing to the appropriate serice.

TriangleServiceImpl.java
------------------------
- Service class that has the implementation of the actual business logic in it.

TriangleType.java
-----------------
- Enumeration for types of triangle.
- Property indicating whether it is a triangle.
- Property indicating the key to search an externalized message.

GlobalExceptionHandler.java
---------------------------
- It serves as a global exception handler in our application.
- It is annotated with @RestControllerAdvice and handles all exceptions being thrown from rest controllers in our application.
- It is a single point for common exception handling and in a larger application all global exceptions should be handled here.
- The code is more structured and eliminates code duplication for common exceptions with the same error handling actions.

TriangleResponse.java
---------------------
- Response class for the REST endpoint.
- In a larger application it might be a container with more fields or a subclass of a general response class.

GeneralErrorResponse.java
-------------------------
- General error response class.
- In a larger application it might have more fields or be the parent class of a hierarchy of errors.

General Programming
-------------------
- Reference through interfaces which allow us to switch easily implementations.
- Single responsibility principle (all classes have only one reason to change).
- Dependency Injection (all dependencies are being injected through constructor injection with the help of Spring Framework).
- Java Based Spring Configuration over XML.
- Spock used as a test framework especially for its expressiveness.


Tech Stack
----------
- Java 8
- Spring Boot 2
- Spring 5 (MVC)
- Freemarker template engine
- REST API using Spring MVC Controllers
- Java Bean Validation Using hibernate validator
- Spock unit test framework
- Bootstrap v4.0
- AngularJS v1.6.9
